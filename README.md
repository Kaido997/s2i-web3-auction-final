## Idea üí°
The idea is to provide a auction site with the win
report saved on the blockchain. 

## Functionality and technology ‚öôÔ∏è

### Technologies :
- Django 
- Redis
- Web3
- Celery

The main functionality is a fast way to register the
bids aside of the main database in this case Sqlite
with Redis. Then with celery that control the schedule
of the auction and the end actions such as:
- update the model on sqlite with the winner
- serialize the model in json and register to the blockchain 
- delete the redis ended auction section to free space
